## Quantal Release Case Study
All code is in MATLAB.

### Exercise 1
*Assume that there are 10 quanta available in a nerve terminal, and for a given release event each is released with a probability of 0.2. For one such event, what is the probability that 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 quanta will be released?*

#### Answer:
In this case, probability of an event having n quanta with each with 0.2 release probability can be determined using a binomial distribution in which n = 10 and p = 0.2. 

Using the code below, a table can be generated giving the probabilities of having n quanta for a given release event. 

```
n = 10; %number of trials/possible quanta
p = 0.2; %probability of quantum release
x = [0:10]'; %array containing all possible numbers of releases x
Probabilities = [x binopdf(x,n,p)]; %compute release probabilities of each number of releases x. 
```

This yields a variable "Probabilities" that represents the release probabilities as below: 
```
x	Probability
0	0.107374182400000
1	0.268435456000000
2	0.301989888000000
3	0.201326592000000
4	0.0880803840000000
5	0.0264241152000000
6	0.00550502400000000
7	0.000786432000000000
8	7.37280000000001e-05
9	4.09599999999999e-06
10	1.02400000000000e-07
```

### Exercise 2
*Let's say you know that a given nerve terminal contains exactly 14 quanta available for release. You have read in the literature that the release probability of these quanta is low, say 0.1. To assess whether this value is reasonable, you run a simple experiment: activate the nerve and measure the number of quanta that are released. The result is 8 quanta. What is the probability that you would get this result (8 quanta) if the true probability of release really was 0.1?* 

This is given by the binomial probability density function, where n = 14, p = 0.1, x = 8, yielding 0.00001595917.

```
n = 14;
p = 0.1;
x = 8;

TrueProb = binopdf(x,n,p);
fprintf('%d',TrueProb)
```

*What about if the true release probability was much higher; say, 0.7?*
Use p = 0.7 instead of 0.1 in above expression, yielding 0.1262023.

```
n = 14;
p = 0.7;
x = 8;

TrueProb = binopdf(x,n,p);
fprintf('%d',TrueProb)

```



*What about for each decile of release probability (0.1, 0.2, ... 1.0)? Which value of release probability did you determine to be the most probable, given your measurement?*
