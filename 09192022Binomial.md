## Quantal Release Case Study
All code is in MATLAB.

### Exercise 1
*Assume that there are 10 quanta available in a nerve terminal, and for a given release event each is released with a probability of 0.2. For one such event, what is the probability that 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 quanta will be released?*

In this case, probability of an event having n quanta with each with 0.2 release probability can be determined using a binomial distribution in which n = 10 and p = 0.2. 

Using the code below, a table can be generated giving the probabilities of having n quanta for a given release event. 

```
n = 10; %number of trials/possible quanta
p = 0.2; %probability of quantum release
x = [0:10]'; %array containing all possible numbers of releases x
Probabilities = [x binopdf(x,n,p)]; %compute release probabilities of each number of releases x. 
```

This yields a variable "Probabilities" that represents the release probabilities as below: 
```
x	Probability
0	0.107374182400000
1	0.268435456000000
2	0.301989888000000
3	0.201326592000000
4	0.0880803840000000
5	0.0264241152000000
6	0.00550502400000000
7	0.000786432000000000
8	7.37280000000001e-05
9	4.09599999999999e-06
10	1.02400000000000e-07
```

### Exercise 2
*Let's say you know that a given nerve terminal contains exactly 14 quanta available for release. You have read in the literature that the release probability of these quanta is low, say 0.1. To assess whether this value is reasonable, you run a simple experiment: activate the nerve and measure the number of quanta that are released. The result is 8 quanta. What is the probability that you would get this result (8 quanta) if the true probability of release really was 0.1?* 

This is given by the binomial probability density function, where n = 14, p = 0.1, x = 8, yielding 0.00001595917.

```
n = 14;
p = 0.1;
x = 8;

TrueProb = binopdf(x,n,p);
fprintf('%d',TrueProb)
```

*What about if the true release probability was much higher; say, 0.7?*

Use p = 0.7 instead of 0.1 in above expression, yielding 0.1262023.

```
n = 14;
p = 0.7;
x = 8;

TrueProb = binopdf(x,n,p);
fprintf('%d\n',TrueProb)

```



*What about for each decile of release probability (0.1, 0.2, ... 1.0)? Which value of release probability did you determine to be the most probable, given your measurement?*

```
n = 14;
p = [0:0.1:1]'; %generate array for values of p between 0 and 1 in 0.1 increments
x = 8;

Probabilities = [p binopdf(x,n,p)]; %compute probabiity of x quanta as a function of varying probabilities of quantum release
```

This yields a variable "Probabilities" that represents probability of exactly 8 quanta as a function of various probabilities of quantum release: 

```
p	Probability of 8 quanta
0	0
0.1	1.59591732300000e-05
0.2	0.00201527918592000
0.3	0.0231800095226701
0.4	0.0918211579084801
0.5	0.183288574218750
0.6	0.206597605294080
0.7	0.126202274067870
0.8	0.0322444669747200
0.9	0.00129269303163000
1	0
```

Thus, of the above values, the value of release probability value associated with the highest probability of 8 quanta is p = 0.6, with a probability of 8 quanta of 0.207. 

### Exercise 3 

*Not feeling convinced by your single experiment (good scientist!), you repeat it under identical conditions. This time you measure 5 quanta that were released. Your sample size has now doubled, to two measurements. You now want to take into account both measurements when you assess the likelihoods of different possible values of the underlying release probability. To do so, assume that the two measurements in this sample are independent of one another; that is, the value of each result had no bearing on the other. In this case, the total likelihood is simply the product of the likelihoods associated with each separate measurement. It is also typical to compute the logarithm of each likelihood and take their sum, which is often more convenient. What are the values of the total likelihood and total log-likelihood in this example, if we assume that the true release probability is 0.1?*

We now have two measurements, x = 8 and x = 5. The other parameters, n = 14, and p = 0.1, are identical to prior. 

Total Likelihood = 1.237819 x 10<sup>-7</sup>
Total Log Likelihood (using base 10) = -6.9073
 
```
n = 14;
p = 0.1;
Meas1 = 8;
Meas2 = 5;
Test = log10(TotalLikelihood);

TotalLikelihood = binopdf(Meas1,n,p) * binopdf(Meas2,n,p);
TotalLogLikelihood = log10(binopdf(Meas1,n,p)) + log10(binopdf(Meas2,n,p));
fprintf('Total Likelihood = %d\n',TotalLikelihood)
fprintf('Total Log Likelihood (using base 10) = %d\n',TotalLogLikelihood)

```

*Of course, knowing those values of the likelihood and log-likelihood is not particularly useful until you can compare them to the values computed for other possible values for the release probability, so you can determine which value of release probability is most likely, given the data. Therefore, compute the full likelihood and log-likelihood functions using deciles of release probability between 0 and 1. What is the maximum value?*

Use for loop below to compute range of total likelihoods and total log likelihoods of obtaining measurements of 8 and 5 across a range of values of p. 

```
n = 14;
p = 0;
Meas1 = 8;
Meas2 = 5;

TotalLikelihoods = zeros(1,3);

for p = 0.1:0.1:1
    TotalLikelihoods = [TotalLikelihoods; p (binopdf(Meas1,n,p)*binopdf(Meas2,n,p)) (log10(binopdf(Meas1,n,p)) + log10(binopdf(Meas2,n,p)))];
end
```

Yields the following TotalLikelihoods array: 

```
p	 TotalLikelihood	 TotalLogLikelihood
0	 0	 0
