## Confidence Intervals and Bootstrapping Exercise

Compute confidence/credible intervals based on the four methods above for simulated data sampled from a population that is Gaussian distributed with mean mu =10 and standard deviation sigma =2, for n=5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 1000 at a 95% confidence level.

### 1. The simple, analytic approach with large *n* and/or known SD. 

### 2. The simple, analytic approach with small *n* and unknown population standard deviation.

### 3. Bootstrapped confidence intervals.

### 4. Bayesian credible intervals.
