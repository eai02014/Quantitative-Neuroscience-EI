## Power exercise

Do a post-hoc power analysis to determine the number of data samples needed to achieve 80% power for a series of possible effect sizes. Notes and tips:
1.	Given that the data have already been collected, note that this is technically a "post-hoc" power analysis and is for demonstration purposes only. Normally these analyses must be done before collecting data.
2.	Assume that a "data sample" is simply the non-parametric correlation coefficient between pupil diameter and LC activty measured in a given session.
3.	Thus, to obtain a null distribution of these data samples, compute the correlation coefficients on simulated data that are independently generated from Poisson (for LC spiking data) and Gaussian (for pupil data)distributions.
4.	Then plot n (number of data samples, corresponding to correlation coefficients measured in a single expermental session) needed for 80% power as a function of effect sizes.
5.	To compute power, you can use TTestIndPower in Python, or sampsizepwr in Matlab

My approach is to generate a null distribution of correlation coefficients (partial Spearman's rho) as described in the question stem and use that as p0 in the power analyses. 

```
%Generate a null distribution of correlation coefficients
NullRhos = [];
for i = 1:1000
    SpikeRate = poissrnd(2,1000,1);
    PupilDiameterZ = normrnd(0,1,1000,1);
    DataArray = [SpikeRate PupilDiameterZ];
    NullRho = partialcorr(DataArray); %generate rho
    NullRhos = [NullRhos; NullRho(1,2)]; %concatenate
end
```

I will then compute p1 for a given effect size d based on the equation for Cohen's d, where mean1 is the correlation of my sample generated based on effect size d, mean2 is the mean of my null distribution, and the standard deviation term in the denominator reduces to the standard deviation of my null distribution, given I only have one sample correlation coefficient.

I will compare p1 and p0 to compute N needed for 80% power at a rnage of effect sizes from 0 to 2. 

```
%Plot number of data samples needed for 80% power as a function of effect
%sizes
%Assume pooled SD = SDnull, since this is what s boils down to in Cohen's d
%if n2 = 1, s2 = 0
Power = 0.8;
MeanNullRho = mean(NullRhos);
SDNullRho = std(NullRhos); 
NNeededs = [];
for EffectSize = 0.001:0.001:2
%EffectSize = 1;
    SampleRho = (SDNullRho * EffectSize) + MeanNullRho; %derived from equation for Cohen's d assuming pooled SD
    NNeeded = sampsizepwr('t',[MeanNullRho SDNullRho],SampleRho,0.80);
    NNeededs = [NNeededs; NNeeded];
end
```

I can then plot this using the following code:
